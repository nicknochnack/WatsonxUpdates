## Insights Analyzed

### Third‑Party Scripts

- **TrustArc** spent **0.6 ms** on the main thread.
- No significant transfer size impact was reported for third‑party scripts.

**Summary:** The page loads with negligible third‑party impact (CLS 0.00). The only measurable cost is a tiny 0.6 ms main‑thread execution by TrustArc. No transfer‑size overhead was identified.

**Recommendations:** While the impact is minimal, consider reviewing the necessity of the TrustArc script and any other third‑party resources. Reducing or deferring them can further improve load performance, especially on slower connections.
